## Getting Started

To start working on this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BELLABEAT-DATA-ANALYSIS.git
   cd BELLABEAT-DATA-ANALYSIS
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

4. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the "notebooks" directory:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Data Analysis Process

1. Data Cleaning: Review and run `data_cleaning.ipynb` to prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Analysis: Explore `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` to uncover insights from the data.
3. Results Interpretation: Examine the charts and findings in the `images/` directory.
4. Final Recommendations: Review the `reports/final_presentation.pptx` for marketing strategy suggestions.

## Key Findings

- Users are most active between 5 PM and 7 PM on weekdays.
- There's a strong correlation between daily steps and calories burned.
- Sleep duration averages 7 hours per night, with high variability on weekends.

## Recommendations

1. Target marketing campaigns during peak activity hours (5 PM - 7 PM).
2. Develop features that encourage consistent sleep patterns.
3. Create challenges that motivate users to increase their daily step count.
